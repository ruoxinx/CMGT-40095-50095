## Viewing and Running the Notebooks Using Google Colab

You can access and run all course notebooks directly in your web browser without needing to install any software, thanks to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Google Colab provides a robust notebook environment that supports Python code execution and is accessible from anywhere.

### How to Use Google Colab:

1. **Open Google Colab**:
   - Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to start.

2. **Access the Notebooks**:
   - In Google Colab, navigate to the 'File' menu and select 'Open notebook'.
   - Switch to the 'GitHub' tab in the dialog that appears.
   - Enter the course repository URL: `https://github.com/ruoxinx/Course-Advanced-Tech-Applications-in-Construction` and press Enter.
   - Browse through the list of notebooks and select the one you wish to open.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   - After selecting a notebook, it will open in a new tab. You can read the content and run the code cells sequentially by clicking on each and pressing `Shift + Enter` or using the play button in the toolbar.

## Installing and Using Notebooks Locally with Jupyter

If you prefer to work with the notebooks on your local machine, you can install Jupyter. For a more enhanced experience, you may opt for JupyterLab, which offers a full-fledged integrated development environment (IDE).

### Installation Guide:

1. **Install Jupyter or JupyterLab**:
   - Visit the [Jupyter official website](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab on your system.

2. **Download the Notebooks**:
   - Clone or download the repository from GitHub to your local machine using the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ruoxinx/Course-Advanced-Tech-Applications-in-Construction.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the repository directory on your computer.

3. **Launch Jupyter**:
   - Open a command terminal and run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
     or
     ```
     jupyter lab
     ```
   - Jupyter will open in your default web browser.

4. **Open and Run Notebooks**:
   - From the Jupyter interface, navigate to the folder containing the downloaded notebooks.
   - Click on a notebook file to open it and start interacting with the contents.

These instructions will help you effectively use and manage the course materials, whether online through Google Colab or locally via Jupyter.
