        "3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with batch size, learning rate, and other YOLOv5 hyperparameters.\n",
        "4. **Real-World Deployment**: Explore integrating your model with live camera feeds for real-time safety monitoring on construction sites.\n",
        "5. **Model Evaluation**: Continuously monitor metrics such as mAP, precision, and recall to improve model performance.\n"
