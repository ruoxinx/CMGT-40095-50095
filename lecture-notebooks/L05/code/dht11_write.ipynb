    "# DHT11 Data Logging with Raspberry Pi\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to read temperature and humidity data from a **DHT11** sensor on a Raspberry Pi using the Adafruit CircuitPython DHT library, and then log the data to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Will Learn\n",
    "1. How to import the required libraries for handling time, board pins, DHT sensors, and CSV file operations.\n",
    "2. How to initialize the DHT11 sensor on a specific GPIO pin.\n",
    "3. How to set up a CSV file for data logging.\n",
    "4. How to continuously read data and handle common errors from DHT sensors.\n",
    "5. How to append data to a CSV file in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** This notebook assumes that you have already installed `adafruit-circuitpython-dht` and `python3` on your Raspberry Pi, as well as `pip` or `pip3` to manage your Python packages. Additionally, make sure that your DHT sensor is connected to a GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi and that you have enabled I2C/SPI as needed (though the DHT uses a single-wire protocol)."

    "In this notebook, we:\n",
    "1. Imported the necessary libraries.\n",
    "2. Initialized a DHT11 sensor on GPIO4.\n",
    "3. Created or overwrote a CSV file and wrote a header.\n",
    "4. Entered a loop to read data from the sensor, print it, and log it to the CSV file every few seconds.\n",
    "5. Handled common errors (`RuntimeError`) gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup allows you to collect temperature and humidity data over time. You can open the CSV file (e.g., `sensor_data.csv`) in a spreadsheet program or use Python to perform further data analysis (plotting, statistics, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- Try using the **DHT22** sensor (uncomment the relevant line and comment out the DHT11 line) for potentially better accuracy and range.\n",
    "- Modify the code to store data in a local or remote database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, etc.).\n",
    "- Create interactive plots in real time using libraries like [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) or [plotly](https://plotly.com/).\n",
